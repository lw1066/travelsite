                      <p>
                          A west coast city of Mexico famous for its glamour in the 1960s.
                          Elvis cliff diving and the great train robbers getaway being two
                          of its most iconic moments in contemporary pop culture.
                          Unfortunately, recent years have seen the city suffer from
                          violence related to drugs and poverty.

                    A city full of ideas. In the short time I spent here the work of Antoni Gaudi left a lasting impression. He designed
                    buildings combining cutting edge technology with extraordinary
                    creativity. Some major works are Parque Güell; Palacio Güell;
                    Casa Mila; the Nativity façade and Crypt of La Sagrada Familia.

              <p>
                A university city on the South coast of England. I live here in
                a converted diamond factory built after the First World War by
                one of the Oppenheimers. Surrounded by the South Downs national
                park and the English channel, there is a lot of nature nearby. 
              </p>
              <p>
                The city is a bustling mix of boutique shopping in the South Lanes, pubs and restaurants in the North Laine, and seaside fun on the pier.

              <p>
                A port city in the Southeast of Spain. A tucked away town on a
                spit of land surrounded by sea. I spent a year in a 7th floor
                flat looking over the sea and long sandy beach. The swimming was
                good but I found the Andalsian accent difficult to adjust to
                after living in Mexico.

                Cuckmere meanders down past Friston forest to flow into the sea
                between the Seven Sisters and Seaford Head. A tranquil retreat

              <p>
                An enchanting undersea world. I worked for around 3 months on a
                live aboard dive boat that travelled between three reefs
                (Hastings, Saxon and Norman) about 70kms off the coast of Cairns
                in the North-East of Australia. The diversity, beauty and
                numnber of creatures on those reefs was a constant joy.

                Greenwich was the headquaters of the Brtish Navy and was a place
                of great wealth and power. The park here is my favourite in

                up. The old town (pictured) is full of interesting buildings,
                stories and pubs. The town has its difficulties but was a great
